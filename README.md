This repo shows the basic usage of TypeScript in a React application. This demo app is built with create-react-app typescript template.

It contains examples of how to:

- define type definition for a component's props object
- define type definition for the state variable and state-setter function of useState
- define type definition for an event handler's event object
- define custom types and use them in various components
